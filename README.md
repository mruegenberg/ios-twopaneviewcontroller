ios-twopaneviewcontroller
=========================

A simple two pane view controller for iPad. Use this if you need functionality similar to `UISplitViewController`, need extra features but don't want to navigate throught the forest of `MGSplitViewController` in search of a working fork.

Features:

- Just two panes, side by side
- Split optionally left or right
- Draggable hiding of one split controller
- Simple code. Written in less than three hours. Less than 200 LoC compared to the 1500 LoC madness of `MGSplitViewController`
- Supports iOS 6 +

Installation

TODO
----
